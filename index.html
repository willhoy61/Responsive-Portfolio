      <p>I am a student at the UT coding bootcamp. I have temporarily left my wife and son in Houston in hopes for a better future in the technology industry. I origianlly went to Culinary school in hopes to be a Chef but realized that was a well thought out plan after our child was born.

      <p>
        In my younger years I would have said I was work hard play hard kinda guy. My recent times are more of work hard and play legos or keep up with the kid at the park. Hopefully when he is older I will be able to take him on slighter larger adventure.
